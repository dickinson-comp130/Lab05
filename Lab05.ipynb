    "How old is the sunlight that we see on Earth?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short and easy answer that you may remember from science class is that it takes about 8 minutes for sunlight to reach the Earth. But, that 8 minutes is just the second part of a [much longer and more interesting journey](https://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php). It only counts the time from when the light leaves the Sun and travels, in a straight line through the vacuum of space, to the Earth. Before it could even begin that journey, the light had to first travel from near the center of the Sun to the surface of the Sun. In this first part of light's journey, from the center of the Sun to its surface, the light is constantly redirected in random directions by collisions with the particles that make up the Sun. Thus, it bounces around, taking a very indirect and random path from the center of the sun to its surface. That random path, it turns out, takes a surprisingly long time. In this lab we will be using scientific simulations to generate an estimate of just how long."

Over 75 years later, Albert Einstein hypothesized that these pollen particles were actually moving the way they did because they were being bounced around by collisions with water molecules."

    "This lab made at least one big assumption... that is that the steps in the random walk are all about 1cm in length.  This 1cm is a commonly used rough estimate of the average step length across the light's full journey from the center of the Sun.  However, closer to the center of the Sun, where it is more dense, the steps would be much shorter than further out where it is less dense.  To improve the estimate scientists modify their random walk to use different step sizes based upon the density of the Sun and current distance from the center. You can check out one example of a simulation that [assumes the density of the sun changes linearly with the distance from the center](http://physics.wooster.edu/JrIS/Files/Walker_Web_Article.pdf) if you are curious."
